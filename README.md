# Palindromes

A palindrome is any word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same both backward or forward.

Create a console application that includes a method to identify whether a word is a palindrome. It should return true if the user-provided word is a palindrome and false if it is not.

There are several recommended approaches:

Simpler: There is a method Array.Reverse(). Check it out in your REPL to see what it does.

More Challenging: Create the method without using the Array.Reverse() method. If you tackle the simpler method fairly quickly, we recommend trying this out!

Bonus Points: Make your method check a string of words and also an integer. For example: "Hello olleH" is a palindrome by our definition. An integer palindrome would be: 101.
